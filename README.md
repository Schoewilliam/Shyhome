## How to install it

1. Clone the repo.
2. Use the App Manager built in Firefox to install it on your Firefox OS device.
3. On your device, navigate to Settings > Homescreen to switch to Shyhome.

*I made this for my own use, it is buggy, cannot do much apart from launching apps (therefore doesn't support homescreen bookmarks), but still, it looks pretty to me.*
